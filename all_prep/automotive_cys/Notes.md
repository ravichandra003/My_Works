## Prep Topics


### Security Standards and Regulations

#### **ISO-21434**
- A global standard outlining requirements for automotive cybersecurity throughout the vehicle lifecycle.  
- Focuses on risk management, threat analysis, and mitigation measures.  
- Ensures cybersecurity is integrated into the design, production, and post-production phases.

#### **UNR-155**
- A United Nations Regulation focusing on vehicle cybersecurity.  
- Mandates the implementation of cybersecurity management systems (CSMS).  
- Addresses risks such as hacking, software updates, and remote access vulnerabilities.

#### **UNR-156**
- A United Nations Regulation concerning over-the-air (OTA) software updates in vehicles.  
- Ensures secure and reliable mechanisms for software updates.  
- Requires robust validation and verification processes to prevent unauthorized changes.



### Communication Protocols

#### **CAN (Controller Area Network)**
- A widely used protocol for in-vehicle communication.  
- Enables real-time data exchange between ECUs (Electronic Control Units).  
- Limited security features, making it susceptible to specific cyber threats.

#### **CAN-FD (Flexible Data Rate)**
- An enhanced version of CAN with improved speed and efficiency.  
- Supports higher data rates and larger data frames.  
- Suitable for modern applications like ADAS and autonomous driving.

#### **FlexRay**
- A high-speed communication protocol designed for safety-critical systems.  
- Provides deterministic data transfer and fault tolerance.  
- Commonly used in applications such as braking and powertrain systems.

#### **Ethernet**
- A modern communication protocol for advanced vehicle networks.  
- Provides high bandwidth for applications like cameras, sensors, and infotainment.  
- Offers improved security compared to traditional automotive protocols.

#### **OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics)**
- A standardized interface for accessing vehicle diagnostics and performance data.  
- Commonly used for emissions testing and vehicle maintenance.  
- Vulnerable to attacks if unauthorized access is obtained.
